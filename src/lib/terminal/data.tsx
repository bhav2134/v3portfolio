		specialization: "🔧 Embedded System Architecture, 🔒 Cybersecurity",
		bio: "Passionate computer science student with a love for low-level systems and security. When I'm not diving deep into embedded architectures or exploring cybersecurity challenges, you'll find me on the rugby field, lost in a fantasy novel, or experimenting with new programming languages. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy the creative process of building solutions - whether that's crafting clean code, cooking up something new in the kitchen, or jamming on my guitar. My curiosity drives me to explore everything from functional programming languages like Haskell to modern web frameworks, always seeking to understand how things work at their core."
